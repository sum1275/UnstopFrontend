# UnstopFrontend

UnstopFrontend is the frontend part of a train seat booking system, designed to efficiently manage seat reservations in a train coach with a capacity of 80 seats.

## Problem Statement

1. The coach has 80 seats, with 7 seats per row except the last row which has 3 seats.
2. A person can reserve up to 7 seats at a time.
3. The priority is to book seats in one row.
4. If not possible, seats are booked as close together as possible.
5. Users can book multiple times until the coach is full.
6. Only the number of seats to be booked is required as input.
7. The system displays booked seat numbers and availability status.

## Setting up the Frontend in Local Environment

To set up UnstopFrontend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
